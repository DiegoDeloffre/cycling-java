# prd-app : use of some app's user data to analyse the cyclists tendencies in Tours, France

***
End of study project in engineering school in computer sciences.

This app is all about resolving pseudo multi-criteria shortest-path problems and then bringing solutions face to face 
with cyclists user data to analyse their tendencies. 

It is also about predicting potential cost improvements in real user
trips based on some hypothetical section modifications  leading to the lowering of
their danger values.

The analysed user data comes from some satellite navigation software dedicated to cycling data from users in Tours, France.
